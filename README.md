Erenshor UI Manager Mod

This mod allows full management of the entire UI.

The features from the Clean Hotbars and Remove UI Borders mods have been integrated into this one. However, those standalone versions are still available for players who prefer using them separately.

Features:

- UI Edit Mode (default key: F9, rebindable).
- Removes the black borders/lines from UI windows. These borders only appear while in UI Edit Mode to help with alignment.
- Removes all blue diamonds. They also only appear in UI Edit Mode.
- Allows dragging all UI elements.
- Allows resetting dragged elements back to the game’s default positions.
- Allows hiding any UI element or window.
- Adds hotkeys for the Group Builder and World Map buttons (default: G and N, respectively, both rebindable). In vanilla, the World Map button loses its hotkey when the minimap is enabled via the server admin panel.
- Buttons tooltip temporarily removed to avoid having to move it to another location if the player moves the buttons.

How to Install:

Requires BepInEx: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx

For easier UI configuration, install BepInEx Configuration Manager: https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases

Download the mod from [here](https://github.com/lucas-xk/Erenshor-UI-Manager/releases).

Copy the compiled DLL into your BepInEx/plugins folder.

Run the game.

Press F1 (by default) to open the Configuration Manager and customize the UI.

Press F9 (by default) to enter or exit the UI Edit Mode and drag UI elements around.

To drag elements that are not draggable by default, use the middle mouse button.
All others can be dragged using their blue diamond handles, as usual.

You can reset the dragged elements back to the game’s default positions using the Configuration Manager. To reset the elements dragged by the blue diamonds, use the vanilla "Reset UI" option on the menu.
